						<br/>Who would have thought something this game changing could be so easy? 
						<br/><br/>VidyoWay’s self-service, web-based interface is intuitive so you’ll get the hang of it right away—no need to buy extra equipment or call in the IT guys. With just a few quick clicks of a mouse, you can connect the most commonly used, disparate enterprise video communication technologies in the market today. Look at you getting Cisco, Polycom, Lifesize, and other H.323 and SIP-based room systems, Microsoft Lync clients, and phones connected to each other and to VidyoConferencing deployments.
						<br/><br/>Here’s more good news: you only have to connect once and you’re set for all future meetings. VidyoWay will leverage your address book and calendar tools to streamline the process going forward. It’s easy for your guests, too. To attend your meeting, participants simply click once from the system or device they’re using and they’re in, too.

						<br/>Once the stuff of science fiction, seamless, effortless, high-quality business-to-business video communication and collaboration is a reality today, thanks to VidyoWay.
						<br/><br/>Until now, crossing the organizational and technological borders between different video conferencing systems in different companies has been difficult, complex, and costly.  If you wanted to link one incompatible system to another, you’d have to buy some pricey equipment and get the IT folks involved.  These barriers have kept businesses from communicating freely and productively with their partners, customers and other key players.
						<br/><br/>Now, VidyoWay makes it easy to cross those boundaries on your own.  This free, interconnectivity platform lets you create an all-inclusive video conferencing community. You can connect Cisco, Polycom and Lifesize endpoints and other H.323 and SIP-based systems.  If you want to connect Microsoft Lync clients and voice-only endpoints, you can do that, too. And if you don’t have access to any of those technologies yourself, Vidyo will give you a free mobile app so you join a meeting from your tablet, smartphone or even an ordinary telephone. With VidyoWay there’s always a way to make the right connections—no matter where, what or when—to keep your business moving forward.
